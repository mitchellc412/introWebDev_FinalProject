            Lesson from this book: <b>Kids are annoying and will get you killed.</b><span class="dots">...</span><br>
            <span class="more">
            <br>Ok I’m slightly exaggerating but have you noticed how frustrating children characters are during a crisis? <br>
            <br>I’m sure they would be during the apocalypse or when being tracked by dinosaurs but I wanted to throw my phone at the wall a few times while reading this book.<br>
            <br>With that said, I now have a new completely reasonable phobia, being eaten alive by a dinosaur.<br>
            <br>Crichton did an amazing job at keeping me on my toes and completely stressed! I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the movie since I remember being traumatized by it as a kid but it totally did!<br>
            <br>I really loved all the science bits which weren't in the movie.<br>
            <br>Worth the read!<br>

        <i>“Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.” </i>
        </blockquote> <b>Jurassic Park</b> has all the major problems of a theme park, a zoo...and genetically altered prehistoric animals. <br>
        <br>That's right - the dinosaurs are back from the dead and nothing - <b>I repeat nothing </b>- could go wrong...right?<br><br><b>
        <i>Ha. </i>
        </b><br>
        <br>As my favorite character, Ian Malcom would say, <blockquote>
        <i>All major changes are like death. You can't see to the other side until you are there.</i>
        </blockquote> Though, considering some of the problems they had with the park, I strongly believe that several of issues<b> could've been predicted</b>...that is, if Mr. Hammond and his scientists would've taken the time to thoroughly consider<b> implications and consequences </b> of bringing back extinct species.<br><br> Dr. Allen Grant, Ellie, Ian Malcom and a host of other professionals (along with Mr. Hammond's grandchildren) are invited to the island to give <b>their expert opinion </b> on this un-extinction.<br><br>Of course, this visit comes at an excellent time - there is a huge storm rolling in, <b>the raptors are getting restless </b>and there's some evidence that the smaller dinos have made it off the island. <b>
        <i>Perrrfect</i>
        </b><br>
        <br>But don't mention any of this to Mr. Hammond or his staff - <b>they won't listen to any negativity.</b>. As Ian Malcom said,<i>
        <blockquote>“They don't have intelligence. They have what I call 'thintelligence.' They see the immediate situation. They think narrowly and they call it 'being focused.' They don't see the surround. They don't see the consequences.”</blockquote>
        </i>Predictably, the storm rolls in, <b>things go very, very wrong</b>...and soon even Mr. Hammond might have to admit that there may be an issue or two in his precious park. <blockquote>
        <i>“You know, at times like this one feels, well, perhaps extinct animals should be left extinct.” </i>
        </blockquote>If I had to pick a<b> single, defining movie</b> from my childhood...this would be it. So, of course, I had to pick up the book to see how it compared.<b> It definitely delivered.</b><br><br>In this novel, Mr. Hammond wasn't quite the <b>bumbling, grandfatherly figure</b> he is in the movie. And of his grandchildren, Lex is certainly younger than her movie-version (and young-Lex was more than a <b>little annoying</b>). <br><br>This is one of those rare cases where the movie is not being a true-to-book adaption, but they are both equally entertaining and delightful. <b>Highly recommended!</b><br><br>And just like when I was a kid, I am comforted that if this dinosaur apocalypse ever happens,<b> things would play out like this:</b> <blockquote>
        <i>“God created dinosaurs. God destroyed dinosaurs. God created Man. Man destroyed God. Man created dinosaurs."<br>
        <br>"Dinosaurs eat man...Woman inherits the earth.” </i>
        </blockquote><i>The Finer Books Club 2018 Reading Challenge - A book with a written inscription</i><br><br><b>Audiobook Comments</b><br>The reader (Scott Brick) was alright. It's just...this book is about DINOSAURS - surely this reader could've mustered <i>some</i> enthusiasm??<br><br><a href="http://bit.ly/33ii2CT" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> | <a href="http://www.mirandareads.com" rel="nofollow">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miranda.reads/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Miranda_Reads" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> | Snapchat @miranda.reads <br><br>Happy Reading!<br>

            <span class="more">
            <br>I was way excited back then, 20 years ago, about the movie (minus the controversial scene portraiting San José, Costa Rica with a beach in the middle of it). Trust me. I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San José and we don't have a dang beach around.<br><br>I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country? Who cares?<br><br>Well, I care, I am from that precise third world country. When you would have your capital cities portraited in a wrong stereotypical way, you will understand me. (And don't get me wrong. I love the movie and I am fan of Spielberg's work, just pointing out my feeling about that scene that even in the book happens in another different place).<br><br>I love the book, since the author, Michael Crichton, lived a lot of time in my country, Costa Rica, and he fell in love so much with our culture and geography that he wanted to use it as background for one of his novels.<br><br>The novel became his most famous book. In the book, you can realize how well Crichton indeed knew about our places using specific real places like the Cabo Blanco Biologic Reserve and the Puntarenas' Hospital Monseñor Sanabria. You don't came out with places like that with your quick internet search. You need to live here to know things like that. <br><br>Of course, <i>Nublar Island</i> is a made up place but hey, no problem there, it's like <i>Gotham City</i> or <i>Metropolis</i>, always there are space for another fictional island in literature.<br><br>I was lucky to get my paperback copy of <i>Jurassic Park</i> just when the movie was on its hype 20 years ago, since thanks to that it has the logo of the film (see? I don't hate the movie, just questioned that dang scene).<br><br>I love my edition of the book since never they published ever again the book with that cover, so it's one my priceless posessions in my library.<br><br><b>
            <u>An insanely popular sci-fi novel with dinosaurs set on my country? Oh, yes! I had to love that book!</u>
