                When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name.

                <br><br>To Summarize: <b>Wellllll...that was convenient...</b><br><br>Thomas wakes up in the middle of a glen in the center a enormous maze. He (along with all of the other guys in there) have <b>no memory</b> of life outside of the maze.<br><br>Absolutely blank slates the lot of them...<b>wellll....mostly.</b><br><br>Their entire lives were <b>conveniently erased</b> just enough so they'd have language, motor skills and just enough memory to understand irrigation/farming but nothing of their personal lives. <br><br>Every month, a <b>newcomer arrives</b> to the Glade. After a brief orientation, they are sorted into a job and society continues. <br><br>The day after Thomas arrives, a girl (Theresa) comes for the first time ever. Thomas and Theresa know each other, but they don't remember how or why. <br><br>All they have is a cryptic message - <b>WICKED is good</b> and a sinking feeling that they are responsible for this whole mess. After all, this is YA lit, thus the main form of motivation has to be: <blockquote>
  <i>I just...feel like I need to save everyone. To redeem myself.</i>
                </blockquote> Anyway, the gladers, Thomas and Theresa spend their time <b>mapping the maze,</b> surviving the wilds and....not much else. I suppose they invent their own slang, which gets a bit annoying after the first twenty pages. <blockquote>
                <i>“You are the shuckiest shuck faced shuck in the world!” </i>
                </blockquote> and <blockquote>
                <i>“I've been shucked and gone to heaven.” </i>
                </blockquote> Besides that bit literary genius, this book wasn't too bad. The adventure and intrigue of the maze was more than enough to keep me entertained. <br><br>That being said...Like most memory-absent books, there's a bit of an issue with the longer it goes on, the <b>less believable</b> it became. <br><br>I mean, what are the odds that the main characters always seemed to know <i>
                <b>just</b>
                </i> enough for the situation and the rest was <i>
                <b>conveniently</b>
                </i> shrouded in shadows? <br><br>I was rather annoyed with the twist at the end. <br><br><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ Mostly because <b>I'm so fed up </b>with the whole Government-secretly-knew-everything-and-manipulated-<b>every-single-string</b>-to-bring-this-about" <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span> <br><br><b>It just feels like lazy writing to me.</b><br><br><b>Audiobook Comments</b><br>Read by Mark Deakins - and he really did a great job with tone and inflection.

                <u>
       <b>Reading this book + No sleep= brain shock</b>
     </u>. Oh more like my brain was blown into freaking little bits. I kept thinking about it after I was done. I finished it into the late hours of the night and I kept circling in my head what was going to happen next. The point is moot but I am <b>definitely</b> going to read the sequel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8587084.The_Scorch_Trials__Maze_Runner___2_" title="The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner, #2) by James Dashner" rel="nofollow">The Scorch Trials</a>.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
     <span class="more">
     <br>From the start as the reader we have <b>NO</b> idea what is happening. All Thomas can remember is his name. Not where he came from or any specific details of his life. Neither do any of the other Gladers who he meets in the beginning of the book. The place is filled with boys whose sole purpose is to try to get out of this place by solving the maze. They haven't had any luck in two years, but that may all change with Thomas's arrival. Strange things start to happen, and people are pointing fingers at Thomas. Will he be the one to get them out, or the boy who will bring them down?<br><br>At first I was having a hard time getting into this book. Nobody wants to answer Thomas's questions, and I got just as frustrated as he did. I actually still don't completely understand why they didn't want to answer all his questions right away. The plot does pick up speed though and you get to meet Newt, Chuck, Minho, and Alby (all important characters in their own right). The world building is good because I got the creeps just <i>thinking</i> about the grievers, and I can feel the desperation but at the same time the camaraderie the guys have with each other. There is also a unique language setup that was a tad-bit confusing at first but you pick it up as Thomas does. The ending certainly is gonna give the series a big shakeup. I <i>really</i> want to see what Dashner has up his sleeve this time.<br><br>I read this because of the good reception it was getting, but also because of a display at Barnes &amp; Nobles. They had all these books that were hugely popular within the young adult realm and I had read all of them except, you guessed it, this one. I couldn't have any of that!<br><br><b>Added later:</b> Great news guys, there are making this into a movie! <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790864/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to the little info that is out about the movie. Basically nothing but hopefully in the coming months that will change!<br><br>Okay the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjQROqddxiY" rel="nofollow">trailer</a> is out! I am officially excited guys.

          Trying to escape in one of the more average stereotypical fanfiction teenage dystopian young adult nightmare battle royal hunger game mix up clones.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
          <span class="more">
          <br>I read pretty much children´s books and YA, especially with a focus on fresh, funny, and unconventional writing styles, but I don´t get the hype around this one, it has just nothing, no complex plots, interesting characters, nothing. It´s always a bad sign if I am losing my focus because it´s boring, implausible, or redundant, which happened several times while reading, but younger readers with fewer airs and graces and not having read the much better other works of the genre, might find it entertaining. <br><br>In contrast, Rick Riordan is ingenious, he transports more info and gives more edutainment that stays in mind about mythology than the whole Western education system and mixes it up with puns without end and innuendos about the current state of the planet.<br><br>Eoin Colfer is one of the most underrated, profound, and best writers in this genre, transporting complicated and difficult topics to kids and teens in an amazing manner.<br><br>Others write perfect popcorn blockbusters without deeper meanings, just finetuned and polished until perfection. <br><br>But Dashner? It´s not so bad, but it feels so puzzled together, using stereotypical characters, no dynamic settings and plotlines and just left me with an average meh, nothing new on planet maze, feeling. It´s highly possible that I just don´t like the writing style in general too, but the fact that the ratings don´t skyrocket after the first part (that is often more exhausting to read because of the establishment and introduction of setting and characters and is therefore punished in the ratings if not executed perfectly), but falls instead to 3,7 to 3,8, speaks for an average one hit wonder.<br><br>Because of the sheer amount of similar, much better literature I would suggest just reading the first part (and the fifth one although I haven´t read it, as the ratings seem to speak of an improvement to 4,1 and yes, I am very into collective rating intelligence if it´s a genre one likes (and not strange people going crazy by reading genres they don´t get cozy with or don´t like and punishing the writers with bad ratings) ) or choosing one of the other, amazing series. <br><br>Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: <br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMazeRunner">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...</a>
