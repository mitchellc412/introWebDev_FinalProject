            <p>Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called House of Horrors. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity‚Äîand skepticism.</p>
            <p>Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father‚Äôs book. But she also doesn‚Äôt believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don‚Äôt exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father‚Äôs death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the past, chronicled in House of Horrors, lurk in the shadows. And locals aren‚Äôt thrilled that their small town has been made infamous thanks to Maggie‚Äôs father. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself‚Äîa place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father‚Äôs book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction.</p>
            <p>In the latest thriller from New York Times bestseller Riley Sager, a woman returns to the house made famous by her father‚Äôs bestselling horror memoir. Is the place really haunted by evil forces, as her father claimed? Or are there more earthbound‚Äîand dangerous‚Äîsecrets hidden within its walls?</p>

            <description>
                Riley Sager is the award-winning pseudonym of a former journalist, editor and graphic designer who previously published mysteries under his real name.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
                <span class="more">
                    <p>Now a full-time author, Riley's first thriller, FINAL GIRLS, became a national and international bestseller and was called "the first great thriller of 2017" by Stephen King. Translation rights have been sold in more than two dozen countries.</p>
                    <p>Riley's next two books, THE LAST TIME I LIED and LOCK EVERY DOOR, were instant New York Times bestsellers. His most recent book, HOME BEFORE DARK, was published in July.</p>
                    A native of Pennsylvania, Riley now lives in Princeton, New Jersey. When he's not writing, he enjoys reading, cooking and going to the movies as much as possible. His favorite film is "Rear Window." Or maybe "Jaws." But probably, if he's being honest, "Mary Poppins."<br>

                <br>Creepy maybe haunted house.
                <br>Unfolding the mystery of said house with splices of the book the main character's dad wrote about the house.<br>
                <br>At first glance this book sounds like horror but it's definitely a thriller that had me guessing.
                <br>I really loved it!<br>

            <br>Maggie Holt has just inherited Baneberry Hall, a rambling estate set deep in the Vermont Woods.<br>
            <br>Twenty Five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, fled this house in the dead of the night, leaving everything behind, after only 19 days in residence. <br>
            <br>Tap-tap-Tap<br>
            <br>And, then THAT song...<br>
            <br>‚ÄúYou are sixteen, going on ...‚Äù 
            <br>would begin to play on the old record player left behind...üíø<br>
            <br>The song, cut off by the noise that always arrived at 4:54 AM<br>
            <br>THUD<br>
            <br>A house remembers.....<br>
            <br>At least that‚Äôs what Maggie‚Äôs father claimed in his best-selling NON-FICTION book, ‚ÄúHouse of Horrors‚Äù....a book that Maggie doesn‚Äôt believe a word of. <br>
            <br>She was only five, when they lived in the house, and she doesn‚Äôt remember the people or events mentioned, or the ‚Äúghosts‚Äù she was terrified of, ‚ÄúMiss Pennyface‚Äù and ‚ÄúMister Shadow‚Äù. <br>
            <br>In fact, she is downright angry that the book defined her and she feels exploited. üß∏<br>
            <br>But once she returns to the old Victorian home, to renovate it, in preparation to sell and begins to experience the strange occurrences chronicled in her father‚Äôs book, she begins to wonder, if perhaps he really was telling the truth...<br>
            <br>I loved how the story was a ‚Äúbook within a book‚Äù....the chapters from Ewan‚Äôs best seller, alternating with Maggie‚Äôs current day perspective. <br>
            <br>AFTER you read the LAST chapter, go ahead and reread the first one......<br>
            <br>Thank You to Edelweiss, Dutton Publishing and Riley Sager for the digital ARC I received in exchange for a candid review!<br>

            <span class="more">
                <br><b>Sager is a King of Spook and all I can say is that he seriously comes through with this book!</b> We have a huge, secluded spooky house with lots of eerie noises and unexplained happenings and a woman in search of the truth of what happened there that caused her family to flee the house in the middle of the night and never return. <br>
                <br><i>I love a good ghost story and this was GOOD!</i> As Maggie Holt tries to unravel the house's mystery and her past we learn that this house has and its past inhabitants had some freaky history. I LOVED the background of the house and having it's story come to life. We also get Maggie's Dad's story told via chapters of the book her wrote on the house. Those were some of my favorite parts of the book. I was soooooo hooked!!! It was awesome to see parallels of the family's experience and Maggie's in the present. She grew up believing her Dad was a liar and wrote the book to make money but could the house really be haunted? Could the story really be true? What really happened to them all those years ago? What happened to her??? <br>
                <br>This is one book you will not want to miss this summer when it releases! Just be sure to read it with the light on!<br>
                <br><i>A huge thank you to Riley Sager, Penguin Publishing and Edelweiss for an advance copy of this book to read &amp; review.</i><br>
