            <p>
                Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious 
                elixer, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary
                murderer: his tagets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and
                attack the innocent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But not everything monsterous looking is evil and not everything fair is good...
                and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.

                Andrzej Sapkowski, born June 21, 1948 in Łódź, is a Polish fantasy writer. Sapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. His first short story, The Witcher (Wiedźmin), was published in Fantastyka, Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of The Witcher, comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
                <span class="more">
                    <br>The main character of The Witcher (alternative translation: The Hexer) is Geralt, a mutant assassin who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in an ambiguous moral universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe. The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by Slavic mythology.<br>
                    <br>Sapkowski has won five Zajdel Awards, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" (Lesser Evil) (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" (Sword of Destiny) (1992) and "W leju po bombie" (In a Bomb Crater) (1993), and two for the novels "Krew elfów" (Blood of Elves) (1994) and "Narrenturm" (2002). He also won the Spanish Ignotus Award, best anthology, for The Last Wish in 2003, and for "Muzykanci" (The Musicians), best foreign short story, same year.<br>
                    <br>In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious Polityka's Passport award, which is awarded annually to artists who have strong prospects for international success.<br>
                    <br>In 2001, a Television Series based on the Witcher cycle was released in Poland and internationally, entitled Wiedźmin (The Hexer). A film by the same title was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.<br>
                    <br>Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Ukrainian, and Portuguese. An English translation of The Last Wish short story collection was published by Gollancz in 2007.<br>
                    <br>The Polish game publisher, CD Projekt, created a role-playing PC game based on this universe, called The Witcher, which was released in October 2007. There is also a mobile version of the game which has been created by Breakpoint Games and is being published by Hands-On Mobile in Western Europe,Latin America and Asia Pacific.<br>
                    <br>The English translation of Sapkowski's novel Blood of Elves won the David Gemmell Legends Award in 2009.

        Think about a fantasy book. Think about your favorite fantasy book. Chances are, it included elves or maybe dwarves. It probably had knights or something like them. It was, most likely, heavily influenced by Tolkien,<span class ="dots">...<br></span>
        <span class="more">
        or his successors, and it was probably based, at least in part, on a certain Anglo-saxon, or maybe French, sort of medieval culture. And if you read fantasy, there's probably 15 or so more like it on your bookshelf or your e-reader of choice.<br>
        <br>So here's my recommendation: put down Lord of the Rings. You've already read it. Put aside that new George R. R. Martin. It'll give him a chance to write a little further ahead, and you'll get a chance to read it again before the next one comes out. 
        Set aside your Jordan, your Eddings or even your Pratchett. Do it, just for a little while. Just for the 2 days or so that it will take you to devour a series of short stories that have a totally different flavor. The stories of Geralt, the Witcher, professional monster hunter, sorcerer, swordsman and mutant. 
        And you should do it for the same reason that you shouldn't have the exact same food at every meal. These short stories will leave you wanting so much more, and by the time you put it down, your last wish will be for the rest of the series to finally be translated from Polish to English so you can find out what happens next.<br>

                <b><i>“People” - Geralt turned his head - “like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves.”</i></b>
                <br>
                <br>I have loved this series for many years now. When I read it, it was arguably the least famous one among my favourite fantasy series. <i>The Witcher Saga</i> by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski is still something of a diamond in the rough, with its own very particular sense of raw beauty. This is not something I’d recommend to just about anyone, but I would call it absodamnlutely amazing without a moment of hesitation.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
                <span class="more">
                <br>While it is not a part of the main saga per se, <i>The Last Wish</i> is definitely my favourite Witcher book. It’s a collection of tales about a man hunting monsters for money. And it's amazingly good. It is also definitely the place to start reading Witcher stories for those looking for a gateway into this wonderful world.<br>
                <br>Like a lot of other people, I was introduced to the world of Andrzej Sapkowski through the video games <i>The Witcher</i> and <i>The Witcher II: Assassins of Kings</i>. These are easily some of the best fantasy RPG's ever made (I would certainly recommend them to all the gamers here), and they made me want to know more about this fascinating world. And as much as love the books, I will continue to insist that the more recent third game in the series, <i>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</i> is the single greatest contribution to the Witcher universe, let alone the greatest fantasy RPG of our time.<br>
                <br>Do not make the mistake of thinking these are mere tie-in novels, however. Whether you come from the games or from the Netflix adaptation, keep in mind that this is the source material, and where the original ideas are found. The adaptations in other media were based on the books, not the other way around, and should be viewed that way. And not only that, but the games are sequels to the books, and thus the books should by all means be read first. That does not mean you cannot enjoy them if you’ve already played the games, but to fully experience this wonderful saga in the best way possible, reading the books first is the way to go.<br>
                <br>Sapkowski introduces the reader to a beautiful combination of Slavic mythology, a distinct eastern European setting, and classical high fantasy. That makes for a different read from a lot of other works within the genre, while at the same time keeping all the mandatory aspects of epic fantasy (magic, elves, kings...). The writing is almost lyrical, but in a relaxed manner, and the English translation is good. But the characters and the setting are what really makes this a great novel. Geralt of Rivia is the most interesting and fascinating protagonist in the fantasy genre, bar none, and the world in which he lives is in many ways different from all others. His one true love, Yennefer of Vengerberg, is one of my favourite fantasy characters of all time.<br>
                <br>The creativity when it comes to the setting is brilliant. The whole concept of Witchers, human mutants bred and trained to slay monsters, is extraordinarily fascinating. And the monsters themselves no less so. You have well-known monstrosities like vampires and werewolves, legendary creatures like chimeras and manticores, and the most interesting of them all, the deadly striga. Most of the world is built on the foundations of fairytales and mythology, mainly Eastern European, but Sapkowski forges it into something truly astounding.<br>
                <br>The narrative is also really well constructed. The book opens up with a frame story set in a Temple of Melitere, where Geralt is recovering from his injuries. From there, he tells stories of his greatest exploits, every now and then going back to the present for a short interlude. While each story is modelled on a classic fairytale, they always add something unique and distinctly flavourful.<br>
                <br>This is, as mentioned earlier, a collection of short stories about the witcher Geralt riding around the countryside, talking to people, killing the occasional monster, and riding on. Sometimes he accepts a contract from a peasant, sometimes from a king. All that matters is the reward. If what you're looking for while reading fantasy is just an epic story of wars and politics and intrigue, you could probably just skip this and continue on to <i>the Witcher Saga</i> itself, starting with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6043781.Blood_of_Elves__Witcher___1_" title="Blood of Elves (Witcher, #1) by Andrzej Sapkowski" rel="nofollow">Blood of Elves</a>. But you would really miss something.<br>
                <br>I loved this book both for its simplicity and for its beautiful descriptions, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, especially those who would like to try something a little different.<br>

            So, this is a collection of short stories loosely threaded around a stay by our point-of-view character, the eponymous witcher, at a temple while recuperating from his latest fight.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
            <span class="more">
            <br>The stories are mostly (all?) retellings of / inspired by well known fairy stories, like Beauty and the Beast. They share a slightly fairy tale vibe too. It's a world where destiny is a real force and unlikely promises about first born children etc made to strangers carry their own weight both magically and in popular opinion.<br>
            <br>The witcher himself is a fairly opaque character. We get tantalising hints about his origins and training, but he seems to be a mature man at the height of his powers, and there's not much by way of personal growth going on here. <br>
            <br>We find him to be a rather stern fellow set to the slaying of monsters for money but bound about by a rather unclear professional and ethical code.<br>
            <br>The society described is a rather misogynistic one, and the witcher is certainly not swimming against the tide in this regard.<br>
            <br>In the Beauty and the Beast story our Beast was cursed by a priestess he happened to be raping (she then kills herself). The witcher commiserates with the Beast, who is portrayed as a jolly and quite good natured fellow, and ends up freeing him from the curse with the added bonus that his new human form is much better looking than his old one.<br>
            <br>The world's take on female magic-users is also … interesting:<br>
            <br>"so only daughters with no chance of finding a husband became sorceresses"<br>
            <br>"the result was pseudo-pretty women with the angry and cold eyes of ugly girls"<br>
            <br>All this aside, I actually enjoyed the book a lot. The stories have a refreshingly different feel to them, partly due to the fairy tale vibe and I guess because the author draws on his eastern European heritage to colour in his backgrounds.<br>
            <br>Additionally, there's lots of imagination on show, the writing has a strong voice, and the witcher is an entertaining character.<br>
            <br>I think this is only the second translated fantasy book I've read (the first being <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27712.The_Neverending_Story" title="The Neverending Story by Michael Ende" rel="nofollow">The Neverending Story</a>). I was never bored, and whilst I'm not rushing to read the rest of the series, I am certainly not ruling it out. I look forward to giving the upcoming TV show a try.<br>
            <br>Oh - I should have mentioned insta-love. There's that too. Also elves. And dwarves. And a whole bunch of interesting monsters, though mostly mentioned rather than battled.<br><br><br><br> <a href="http://eepurl.com/cimnK1" rel="nofollow">Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes</a>
