                  A world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no misery.
                  Humanity has conquered all those things, and has even conquered death.
                  Now scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are commanded to do so, in order to keep the size of the population under control.
                <p>Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that neither wants. 
                  These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.

        <div class="description">

            <description>Award-winning author Neal Shusterman grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he began writing at an early age. After spending his junior and senior years of high school at the American School of Mexico City, Neal went on to UC Irvine, where he made his mark on the UCI swim team, and wrote a successful humor column. Within a year of graduating, he had his first book deal, and was hired to write a movie script<span class="dots">...</span><br>
                <span class="more">
                <p>In the years since, Neal has made his mark as a successful novelist, screenwriter, and television writer. As a full-time writer, he claims to be his own hardest task-master, always at work creating new stories to tell. His books have received many awards from organizations such as the International Reading Association, and the American Library Association, as well as garnering a myriad of state and local awards across the country. Neal's talents range from film directing (two short films he directed won him the coveted CINE Golden Eagle Awards) to writing music and stage plays – including book and lyrical contributions to “American Twistory,” which is currently playing in Boston. He has even tried his hand at creating Games, having developed three successful "How to Host a Mystery" game for teens, as well as seven "How to Host a Murder" games.</p>
                <p>As a screen and TV writer, Neal has written for the "Goosebumps" and “Animorphs” TV series, and wrote the Disney Channel Original Movie “Pixel Perfect”. Currently Neal is adapting his novel Everlost as a feature film for Universal Studios.</p>                
                <p>Wherever Neal goes, he quickly earns a reputation as a storyteller and dynamic speaker. Much of his fiction is traceable back to stories he tells to large audiences of children and teenagers -- such as his novel The Eyes of Kid Midas. As a speaker, Neal is in constant demand at schools and conferences. Degrees in both psychology and drama give Neal a unique approach to writing. Neal's novels always deal with topics that appeal to adults as well as teens, weaving true-to-life characters into sensitive and riveting issues, and binding it all together with a unique and entertaining sense of humor.</p>               
                <p>Of Everlost, School Library Journal wrote: “Shusterman has reimagined what happens after death and questions power and the meaning of charity. While all this is going on, he has also managed to write a rip-roaring adventure…”</p>                
                <p>Of What Daddy Did, Voice of Youth Advocates wrote; "This is a compelling, spell-binding story... A stunning novel, impossible to put down once begun.</p>               
                <p>Of The Schwa Was Here, School Library Journal wrote: “Shusterman's characters–reminiscent of those crafted by E. L. Konigsburg and Jerry Spinelli–are infused with the kind of controlled, precocious improbability that magically vivifies the finest children's classics.</p>                
                <p>Of Scorpion Shards, Publisher's Weekly wrote: "Shusterman takes an outlandish comic-book concept, and, through the sheer audacity and breadth of his imagination makes it stunningly believable. A spellbinder."</p>          
                <p>And of The Eyes of Kid Midas, The Midwest Book Review wrote "This wins our vote as one of the best young-adult titles of the year" and was called "Inspired and hypnotically readable" by School Library Journal.</p>           
                <p>Neal Shusterman lives in Southern California with his children Brendan, Jarrod, Joelle, and Erin, who are a constant source of inspiration!</p>

            5/5 Stars!! One of my absolute favorite books I have read in a while. 
            A <b>MUST MUST MUST READ.</b> I can’t even begin to string coherent words together for a review. I love everything about this novel.<br>
            <br>Check out my video review!: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d37f6KCE3kk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d37f6...</a><br>
            
            <br>TW: murder/death, suicide<span class="dots">...</span><br>
            <span class="more"><br>The world of <i>Scythe</i> is fascinating. With so many advances due to technology and research, it becomes a plausible future for our society which is equal parts interesting and terrifying. 
            This story poses a lot of thought-provoking conversations about morality and mortality. It is by far one of the most complex and well-developed YA worlds I have experienced in a very long time. 
            My brain was running wild throughout the entire story.<br><br>The world and the plot of <i>Scythe</i> are my absolute favorite parts of the book. 
            I’ve seen many reviews claiming the story is boring, and while I can somewhat agree that the pacing is slower in the beginning, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while reading. 
            There are so many plot twists, all unexpected that completely fed the plot-driven reader in me. Every time I accepted the story was going in one direction, it would take a complete 180 which made for an exhilarating read. I’m thoroughly shook with how much I adored this story.<br><br>I also really loved the characters. Citra is super strong and intelligent, while Rowan goes through some serious development in a morally-grey way. 
            I think they have a great dynamic, though I feel their romance was one of the weakest parts of the book. There was so much potential to see them grow together, yet I don’t feel we really got to see WHY they were so loyal to each other or WHY they were so attracted to each other. I thought they were really great friends who had a great chance of growing into something more, but the story sort of skipped over the development of feelings. I’m very hopefully things become more natural in <i>Thunderhead</i> because I can see so many good things to come with their relationship.<br><br><i>Scythe</i> was amazing. I cannot stop thinking about it. Please please please read it!!<br><br><i>I received a free copy of this book from Simon &amp; Schuster as a part of a paid YouTube campaign. 
            I had <b>no</b> obligation to review this book as a part of that campaign and all opinions are my own.</i>

              Pretty much a perfect teen adventure novel. In a conflict-free world where humans have conquered death, elected Scythes must cull the human population. Two teens find themselves volunteered as apprentice-Scythes, and discover that of all the things that Scythes can kill, corruption is not one of them<span class="dots">...</span><br>
              <span class="more"><br>1. Over the years, I've heard many books touted as the successor to Hunger Games, but SCYTHE is the first one that I would really, truly stand behind, as&nbsp;it offers teens a complementary reading experience to that series rather than a duplicate one. Like Hunger Games, SCYTHE invites readers to both turn pages quickly but also furrow their brows over the ethical questions it asks. Tone-wise, I would place it solidly between M. T. Anderson's FEED and Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series.<br>
              <br>2. Over the years, YA has come to encompass a wide age range —&nbsp;one that I feel tends to skew ever older and sometimes forget the folks who are growing out of middle grade, but slowly. SCYTHE strikes me as a true teen novel, one that I will happily thrust into the hands of even reluctant 12-14 year old readers to show them what awaits them in genre fiction. It asks enough difficult questions to stick in the mind, but it never asks them at the expense of pacing or story. Although it's a series-starter and the end is tantalizing, it does feel like it satisfyingly stands alone (as is evidenced by its new Printz Honor sticker —&nbsp;the Printz is very rarely awarded to series books as the novel's merit must be contained entirely within the volume awarded). Moreover, it is very light on the romance, something that younger readers often prefer (and somewhat difficult to find in YA).<br>
              <br>3. Over the years, I have grown too lazy to make note of when sequels come out. I've made a note on my calendar for this one, though —&nbsp;November 2017. I look forward to another good time.

              The characters and plot are fun and well developed — a cool, new dystopian that I’m onboard with. There’s definitely a violent element and theme in the story that I found both interesting and compelling, especially the attempted distinction between murder and gleaning that moves the plot along.
