Quick notes about the book description pages. The background color is the actual page color of most novels (I found the hex value #f2eecb online) and the font used for everything BUT the reviews is one of the more common fonts used when a book is printed. Lastly, the format of the reviews were kept to be as close as possible with the original format on GoodReads.
