            <p>Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen.</p>
            <p>The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature.</p>
            <p>A high-action story written with a poet's hand, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.</p>

                It all began when Pat Rothfuss was born to a marvelous set of parents. 
                Throughout his formative years they encouraged him to do his best, gave him good advice, and were no doubt appropriately dismayed when he failed to live up to his full potential.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
                <span class="more">
                    <p>Most of Pat's adult life has been spent in the University Wisconsin Stevens Point. In 1991 he started college in order to pursue a career in chemical engineering, then he considered clinical psychology. In 1993 he quit pretending he knew what he wanted to do with his life, changed his major to "undecided," and proceeded to study whatever amused him. He also began writing a book....</p>
                    <p>For the next seven years Pat studied anthropology, philosophy, eastern religions, history, alchemy, parapsychology, literature, and writing. He studied six different martial arts, practiced improv comedy, learned how to pick locks, and became a skilled lover of women. He also began writing a satirical advice column which he continues to this day: The College Survivial Guide. Through all of this he continued to work on his novel.</p>
                    <p>In 2000 Pat went to grad school for English literature. Grad school sucked and Pat hated it. However, Pat learned that he loved to teach. He left in 2002 with his masters degree, shaking the dust from his feet and vowing never to return. During this period of time his novel was rejected by roughly every agent in the known universe.</p>
                    <p>Now Pat teaches half-time at his old school as an assistant-sub-lecturer. He is underpaid but generally left alone to do as he sees fit with his classes. He is advisor for the college feminists, the fencing club, and, oddly enough, a sorority. He still roll-plays occasionally, but now he does it in an extremely sophisticated, debonair way.</p>
                    <p>Through a series of lucky breaks, he has wound up with the best agent and editor imaginable, and the first book of his trilogy has been published under the title "The Name of the Wind."</p>
                    <p>Though it has only been out since April 2007, it has already been sold in 26 foreign countries and won several awards.</p>
                    <p>Pat has been described as "a rough, earthy iconoclast with a pipeline to the divine in everyone's subconscious." But honestly, that person was pretty drunk at the time, so you might want to take it with a grain of salt.</p>

            First of all, I absolutely loved this book. It has been on my tbr for so long and I am so glad I finally read it. It was great and one of the books that will stay with me for a while. I probably wouldn't reread it as I think the beauty of this book is the journey it takes you on the first time as a reader.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
            <span class="more">
                <p>I had only a couple of minor gripes. It didn't really bother me that Kvothe was basically described as this ultimate legend of a being. Fair enough, brings an intetesting story. However, with that in mind, I then don't like the break in the 4th wall when the narrator says in the story usually the hero does xyz, or in the story, romance is missing, however in Kvothe's case something else happened. I don't know how to quite explain it but that mildly irritated me because a lot of the things that did happen were typical of stories because they worked and therefore, this self awareness of a plot line was redundant in my opinion.<br>Also, Kvothe's age and his behaviour did not match. I get he is supposed to be the genius of all geniuses but in the present he is in his twenties if I understood correctly and then in the story, he is 15. He is behaving like he is 70 and 30 respectively. It is just jarring.</p>
                   But anyway, it was grand and I can't wait to dig into the second book.<br>

              I'll give this 5* with no begrudging. I'm pretty easy with my 5*, they're not reserved for the best book I've ever read, just very good books. I thought The Name of the Wind was "very good". I read it in what for me was a very short span of time - it had that 'more-ish' quality that best sellers need.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
              
              <span class="more">
              <br>Can I see what makes this the single best selling epic fantasy for a generation (apart from George Martin's series)? No. Excepting that perhaps the lesson is that to be head and shoulders above your competition in sales "all" you need is to be better by a nose - after that the non-linear dynamics of the market take over and elevate you to godhood.<br><br>I loved the writing, and that's very important to me. Rothfuss often treads the thin line between prose and poetry, and fortunately it's excellent poetry that he brushes up against. The quality of the writing breathes magic into even fairly ordinary scenes, and makes some of the important ones extraordinary.<br>
              <br>The story itself is mostly compelling. It uses the reverse of the device I saw recently in Blood Song of a framing story that's not in the first person, delivering up a first person narrative. Our hero, Kvothe has bags of attitude and is a total genius at everything. To balance out his 'all power' we have his poverty, bad luck, tendency to dig himself into a hole, and his powerful enemies. <br>
              <br>Kvothe's real powerful enemy sits in the background as a motivator (&amp; presumably story for books 2 &amp; 3) while his 'school-boy' adversary at the university fills in for bad guy for most of the book.<br>
              <br>Like Blood Song, and many other really successful books, TNOTW is at its core a school story. Harry Potter, Wizard of Earthsea etc all feature magic schools, for Blood Song and Enders' Game it was a battle school, but the point is that the schools + lessons + masters combo sells bucket loads if you write it really well and plumb it into a compelling larger picture.<br><br>With magic the school system also provides a painless way of educating your readers in the magic-system you have (by virtue of it being delivered through formal education) elected to use.<br>
              <br>Was there anything wrong with it? For me the whole 'and then I broke another string' and 'I was very hungry and dirty in Tarbean' sections were rather slow and lengthy - I understand their role in the story but they felt overplayed. And at the end the whole business with the draccus felt tangential and diluted the endgame for me. But no, nothing of great significance.<br>
              <br>A final observation: throughout the book we (like Kvothe) are constantly aware of money. Kvothe's poverty is a driver and source of tension. He is constantly coming into money, losing it, incurring costs. We almost know the contents of his purse at any time and the price of all his needs. To me this was very reminiscent of Dostoyevsky's work (and to a lesser extent, Dickens) where a similar focus on the number of coins in our character's pocket is maintained and the need to cover their expenses drives much of the story.<br><br>In short though, given the impossible level of expectation built up by years of hearing how incredible this book is ... the text made a very good attempt to live up to its reputation.<br>

          THIS. BOOK. WAS. SO. FREAKING. GOOD.<span class="dots">...</span><br>
          <span class="more">
          <br>I'm not over it. Everyone was right it's amazing and I love it so much and I'm still sad the third book isn't out even though it's been basically six years it's fine EVERYTHING IS FINE.<br>
          <br>This book has all the makings of a great fantasy. Amazing world building. Characters that you connect with &amp; that grow. Plot that moves along very well and is supremely interesting. It's got it all.<br>
          <br>One thing I also appreciated is how simple the magic system is. It's pretty easy to understand the basics so there isn't a ton of info-dumping.<br>
          <br>I also listened to the audiobook part of the time and really really enjoyed it!<br>
          <br>It's just great and you should read it.<br>
